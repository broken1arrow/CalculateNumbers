# CalculateNumbers

With this expation you can get a number after how damage a tool or armor are and include rank names, has yml config file
you can change some of the values. You can for example make dimond armor cheaper or more expensive an Iron arnor. If you 
will have it on tools and wapens too, I will look on that for a future update. 

Will print out ether 15 or 15.45 (depending what you add in your placeholder). You not have to add {a placeholder from 
your ranking plugin} work with out too (but you will lose that ability and recommend you twek the numbers).





# Placeholders

For tools no decimals:
* %number_numbervalue,tool:{a placeholder from your ranking plugin}%
 
For tools with two decimals:
* %number_numbervalue,decimal,tool:{a placeholder from your ranking plugin}%

For armor no decimals:
* %number_numbervalue,armor:{a placeholder from your ranking plugin}%

For armor with two decimals:
* %number_numbervalue,decimal,armor:{a placeholder from your ranking plugin}%
